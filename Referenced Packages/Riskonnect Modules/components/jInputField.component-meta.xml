    <description>This component renders an apex:inputField with a consistent &quot;div class=&apos;fieldInputBlock blockifyMe [requiredInput]&apos;&quot; wrapper, to aid the 
                 jController plugin in finding/modifying fields. Note that it also &quot;block-ifies&quot; the ridiculous span wrapper that Apex throws around custom 
                 components, to ensure more consistent behavior in jQuery&apos;s &quot;:hidden&quot; selector, for jController. If the &quot;required&quot; attribute is passed as true, 
                 the field will be rendered to look exactly like a standard Visualforce required field, without actually flagging it as required to the 
                 platform. Instead, the validation logic will be enforced via jController, since the platform&apos;s logic is very inflexible -- and 
                 jController&apos;s &quot;driverDependents&quot; functionality doesn&apos;t work with platform required fields.</description>
